# Puppy Playdate

"Puppy Playdate" is an app that allows users to find other dogs near by that would be compatible with their man's best friend.


App allows users to set up a profile for their dog based on their dog's preferences and important traits like clean vaccination history.

Users will be provided with matches based on a geo-fenced location, and compatibility.

App will hopefully incorporate messaging features and the ability to add playdates to a calendar.

We plan to utilize MERN for our Project using the MERN passport authentication as well as MERN-based messaging.
